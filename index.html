        <p>Goal is to predict behavior to retain customers.
            by analyzing all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs</p>
        <p class="h2">
            Step 1:
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially I tried to find what percent of customers are leaving the service.
            So that I decide weather it is worth enough to spend time on this analysis. After computing aggregation and plotting in pie chart
            I have noticed more than 25% of customers left the service in a month. Which is quite more and so decided to dig more in to stats to find
            specific customers whome need to be concentrated.
        </p>

        </div>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="h2">
            Step 2:
        </p>
        <p>
            Next I did more analysis on different factors like gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService and
            Contract I have noticed Contract is the cause which is making majority people leave which is nearly 45% of people leaving
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="images/2.png">
        </div>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="h2">
            Step 3:
        </p>
        <p>
            After further analysing the data in terms of gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService and internet
            among the people who are monthly subscribers, I have noticed that people who own fiber optic internet connection are
            the majority of the people leaving the service.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="images/3.1.png">
        </div>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="h2">Conclusion:</p>
        <p>
            Up on careful analysis it is evident that people who are monthly subscribers and own an
            fiber optic internet connection are the majority(close to 30%) for customers who are leaving the service.
            So telecom company has to start providing better offers to this specific group of people to retain them.
